LANraragi
============

Web interface and reader for storage of comics/manga on NAS, running on Perl/Redis/unar with a dash of Imagemagick and Bower.

##Features

##Hotdog ! How do I install this ?  
You can find a basic installation guide [here](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/blob/master/tools/Install.md) for Linux machines.  

##But I don't run Linux, got anything for me ?  
Got you covered ! Kind of.  
I wrote a Vagrantfile you can use with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) to deploy a virtual machine on your computer with LANraragi preinstalled.  
Download [the Vagrant setup](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/raw/master/tools/VagrantSetup) somewhere, and whip out a terminal :
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant up
```
Once it's deployed(it takes a while to download everything), you'll have a /lanraragi folder, which syncs to an install located at [http://localhost:8080/lanraragi](http://localhost:8080/lanraragi) .  
You can use 
```
vagrant halt
```  
to stop the VM when you're done.

##I got me a setup, how do I use this ?
First, login with the default admin password (kamimamita), and hit the configuration page.  
There are multiple settings you can change, including but not limited to the content folder, your password or the reading order.
Afterwards, add your archives in the content folder or through the upload page, and it just worksâ„¢


##Potential roadmap for when I feel motivated enough to take this up again    

* Use Gulp for bundling front-end dependencies on top of bower  

* Database backup/restoration  

* Moving away from CGI
