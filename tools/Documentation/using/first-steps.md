## First Steps and Configuration

**Hot Tip** : If you want to change the used Redis address/database (the defaults are good enough for 98% of people), you can do so by editing the lrr.conf file at the root.

The first step you'll probably do is head to the Configuration page to change/disable the default password.  

When logged in as Admin in LRR, you have access to the full functionalities of the app.  
Unlogged users can only read (and download) archives that are already on the server.  

If you're running the app on a server that's potentially accessible by others, I recommend leaving password protection enabled and changing the default password. (Although there's already a big red popup to remind you of that, you can't really say it enough)  

Besides password protection, the Configuration page has a few detailed lesser settings you can tweak at will.
