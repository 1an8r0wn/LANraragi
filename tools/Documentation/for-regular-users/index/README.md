# Installing LANraragi

## Quick Rundown

### Containers: Simply the best

As LRR is a server app first and foremost, its setup is a bit more complex than your usual Desktop application.  
Therefore, for unexperienced users, I recommend using a **container/VM** install like Docker or Vagrant.  
They're clean, easy to update, and automatically built/tested.

{% page-ref page="docker.md" %}

{% page-ref page="vagrant.md" %}

### Installing from source on Unix systems

{% page-ref page="source-linux.md" %}

Installing from **source** is a more involved procedure, but it does put you in full control and able to hack up the app's files as you wish.

### Windows: üôá‚Äç _please understand_ üôá‚Äç

I used to provide a one-click Windows source port version, but have encountered increasing issues with it as I introduced modern features and dependencies.  
If you just want to try the software, you can still use the old one-click Quickstarter for [v.0.5.6.](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/releases/download/v.0.5.6/LRR_0.5.6_QuickStarter_Windows.zip)

It's _technically_ still possible to run the software on a Strawberry Perl release if you compile all the dependencies needed. The page below is outdated but can serve as a good place to start:

{% page-ref page="source-windows.md" %}

Keep in mind that Batch Tagging will not work at all under Windows due to its reliance on [Mojolicious subprocesses.](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Mojolicious/lib/Mojolicious/Guides/FAQ.pod#How-well-is-Windows-supported-by-Mojolicious?)

### Bonus: Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation

Due to this setup demanding a subsystem usually meant for developers, I wouldn't recommend it for standard users.  
However, it is deceptively simple:

* Step 1: Install the [Redis Windows Port](https://github.com/tporadowski/redis)
* Step 2: Follow the Linux Guide in your WSL terminal, omitting the part about installing Redis.

In this hybrid setup, LRR interacts with the Windows Redis server seamlessly. Magic!

Redis can be installed on the Linux side as well, but one would have to start it by hand alongside LRR on every OS boot.
