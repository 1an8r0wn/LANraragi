# Installing LANraragi

## The chef's recommendation

As LRR is a server app first and foremost, its setup is a bit more complex than your usual Desktop application.  
Therefore, for unexperienced users, I recommend using a **container** install like Docker or Vagrant.  
They're clean, easy to update, and automatically built/tested.

_**Ano ne developer-san, what about this Windows .zip I downloaded from the Releases page?**_

The **QuickStarter** zip is the easiest way to get started on Windows machines - Just open the .bat and you're good to go.  
However, quirks in the Windows port mean you might encounter slight glitches depending on how your Windows is set up.

It's also slightly less clean, less tested, less everything. But it works for most users who try it. Your mileage may vary.

_**I'm a super hacker, can I just install from source?**_

Installing from **source** is a more involved procedure, but it does put you in full control and able to hack up the app's files as you wish.
