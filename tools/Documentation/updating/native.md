## Windows QuickStarter  

Simply overwrite your previous QuickStarter folder with the new one.  
⚠️Do **not** delete the database (dump.rdb) or the content folder!

## Native OS installs (Linux/Windows)

Getting all the files from the latest release and pasting them in the directory of the application should give you a painless update 95% of the time.  

To be on the safe side, make sure to rerun the installer once this is done:
```
npm run lanraragi-installer install-full
```
